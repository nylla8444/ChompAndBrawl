# Pac-man: Chomp and Brawl
A Unity project made for [Odyssey Festival](https://www.facebook.com/OdysseyFestivalPH)'s Game Hackathon which won first place on 08/11/2024 with the theme `Arcade`.


### Description
**Pac-man: Chomp and Brawl** is a combination of the original game Pac-man and Mortal Kombat with an integration of competitive 1v1 multiplayer mode, with new mechanics and branches of gameplay. A round is separated into two parts:
 - **Labyrinth**, wherein both players are brought to a maze with randomly spawning power-ups either helping Pac-man or the ghosts.
 - **Brawl**, where if both players collide in the maze, will be brought to an arena where both must fight until either ones health reaches 0.

The objective of the Pac-man is to collect as many points as possible and take down all ghosts, while the ghosts are hunting down. And, the objective of the ghosts is to take down the pacman three times.
